This project is a React app bootstrapped with Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Supabase as the backend. The application state is managed using Redux Toolkit, making API querying and handling of loading and error states much more straightforward.

The design of the project was done using Figma, and the planning took place in GitHub Projects. This project utilizes npm.
